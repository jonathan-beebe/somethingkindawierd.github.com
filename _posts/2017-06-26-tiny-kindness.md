Often, as a siren approaches me while driving, I find myself surprised my the number of drivers around me who appear oblivious. This happened to me again today, actually. I think that is why [this story](http://kottke.org/17/06/tiny-kindnesses-noticed)  stands out. It is a powerful example of the goodness of people who care.

> I was about to cross a side street in Brooklyn when a concerned-looking man crossing in the opposite direction stood in the middle of the street and began frantically waving a tshirt in front of the cars that were about to get a green light. I quickly realized that he was stopping traffic so that a blocked ambulance with its sirens on could make it through further down. It worked — the traffic cleared and the ambulance moved. When I got a few blocks down in the direction he’d been coming from, EMTs were on the scene, attending to an unconscious, apparently homeless person on the sidewalk. I think most people would call 911, but this guy went the extra mile. **He did what a family member would do.**
