I just wrapped up Lawrence Levy’s _To Pixar and Beyond._ Paired with _Creativity, Inc._ you have a powerful pair of books about one of the most creative companies in existence.

Beyond amazing stories about Pixar these two books are my favorite biographies of Steve Jobs. This one anecdote really stood out. Lawrence tells a story about Steve Jobs creating the slides used to pitch Pixar to investors as they prepared for IPO.

> Steve paid attention to every nuance of the slides, even details that, as far as I could tell, were invisible to the naked eye, like font kerning — which is adjusting the space between letters — and font smoothing to make sure the curves on each font were perfect. He hired a presentation professional, Wayne Goodrich, to help finalize these details and to make sure that at every single stop on the road show, all the pieces were in place to show the presentation and video perfectly.
