> Research indicates that the number one factor in longevity is not social relationships or happiness, but consciousnesses, described as persistence, dependability, and organization.

That quote comes from [_The Entitlement Cure_](http://www.cloudtownsend.com/the-entitlement-cure/) on page 66. This caught my attention, so I dug a bit deeper. The original source for that statement comes from [_The Longevity Project_](http://www.howardsfriedman.com/longevityproject/), which lays out the findings from a lifelong study of 1,500 people.

That is 1,500 people studied from birth to death. Amazing.

The findings are worded another way in a summary of the book:

> If there's a secret to old age, the authors find, itâ€™s living conscientiously and bringing forethought, planning, and perseverance to one's professional and personal life.
