Lawrence Levy, in _To Pixar and Beyond_, shares about Pixar’s battle to maintain their creative potency after their first win with Toy Story. At this point many companies try to exert control over their creative teams and inadvertently squeeze out their creative advantages. Pixar made the hard choice to keep the executives _out_ of the creative process, giving full control to their creative team. Lawrence shared this wisdom in his book:

> Every one of Pixar’s films went through a series of hair-raising creative crises that repeatedly tested our decision. Creative excellence is a dance on the precipice of failure, a battle against the allure of safety. There are no shortcuts, no formulas, no well-worn paths to victory. It tests you constantly.

I highly recommend _To Pixar and Beyond_ and _Creativity, Inc._ to read more about this.
