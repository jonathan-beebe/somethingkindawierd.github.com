> the most common software packages for fMRI analysis (SPM, FSL, AFNI) can result in false-positive rates of up to 70%. These results question the validity of some 40,000 fMRI studies and may have a large impact on the interpretation of neuroimaging results. . . .

No kidding. That is a huge problem. The [paper cited in that article](http://m.pnas.org/content/early/2016/06/27/1602413113.full) says they expected only 5% false-positive results. But perhaps even more interesting was this comment at the end.

> they swipe the fMRI community for their “lamentable archiving and data-sharing practices” that prevent most of the discipline's body of work being re-analysed.

I assumed something as scientific as fMRI scans would always be saved as raw data ready to be reinterpreted. Considering the low cost of data storage and the *huge* advantages of being able to reinterpret the raw data when newer software and methods of interpretation become available, I hope this is a practice that changes soon.
