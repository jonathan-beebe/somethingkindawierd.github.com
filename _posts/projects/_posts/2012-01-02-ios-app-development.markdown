# Dreams (working-title)

In collaboration with [Beebe Hargrove](http://www.beebeart.com/) [(@beebeart)](http://twitter.com/beebeart),
Dreams is becoming a beautiful, immersive, full-screen iPad book.

This original story, written and illustrated by Beebe Hargove, is in the early
stages of being brought to life. Each page is fully interactive, allowing children to touch, shake,
blow, and experience the world of the dreamer.

I will post more shortly as we continue to develop the app.

# Vela Player

The [Vela Player](http://www.velaapp.com/app/ "Vela — Hands Free Music") concept is simple:
a pleasant gui wrapping streaming music services such as
RDIO and Rhapsody. Add to this a modern voice-recognition service to enable
voice-assisted exploration of these extensive music libraries.

The challenge came when we were approached with the project after the owner had
already been working with developers for over 1&frac12; years. The app was, at best,
a half-working prototype at that point. My task was to re-build Vela Player in
the shortest time possible, making up for the already lost time.

Our team managed to complete version 1 within 30 days, delivering a working
music player integrating with the RDIO music service, enhanced by Nuance's Dragon
Speech Recognition software.
