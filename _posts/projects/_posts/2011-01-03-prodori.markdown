Prodori
=======

Prodori is an elegant site designed to compete in the jewelry market.

I did not design the site; I made it work.

</div>

About the Project
-----------------

This company likes to use home-grown solutions. The entire Prodori site is built using a homegrown PHP5 MVC framework very similar to [Yii](http://yiiframework.com "Yii -- perhaps the most awesome php framework yet").

My contributions include:

*	Contributing to the core framework.
*	Integrating Prodori's shopping cart into the existing inventory systems.
*	Implementing backend tools for customer service and sales staff to maintain the site and its resources.
*	Implementing much of the front-end, such as integrating existing jQuery plugins &amp; writing javascript to power the interface.

Here's some screenshots of interface elements I worked on:

<div class="img half left">
<img src="/images/projects/prodori/login-form.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="img half right">
<img src="/images/projects/prodori/scrollbars.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="img full left">
<img src="/images/projects/prodori/store-filters.jpg" />
</div>

A notable exception to the use of homegrown solutions is in the use of javascript. One of the original goals was to provide a very fluid, 
animated browsing experience without flash. We relied heavily on jQuery and its rich plugin ecosystem.
