About the Project
-----------------

This company likes to use home-grown solutions. The entire Prodori site is built using a homegrown PHP5 MVC framework very similar to Yii.

My contributions include:

*	Contributing to the core framework.
*	Integrating Prodori's shopping cart into the existing inventory systems.
*	Implementing backend tools for customer service and sales staff to maintain the site and its resources.
*	Implementing much of the front-end, such as integrating existing jQuery plugins &amp; writing javascript to power the interface.

A notable exception to the use of homegrown solutions is in the use of javascript. One of the original goals was to provide a very fluid, 
animated browsing experience without flash. We relied heavily on jQuery and its rich plugin ecosystem.
