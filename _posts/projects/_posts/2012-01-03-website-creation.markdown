# Website Creation

Here is a brief list (by no means comprehensive) of the most recent websites I've created.

## Custom web-apps

Each of these projects was a ground-up creation. Some I built on my own, others as part of a team.
Within each I participated in (or completed myself) the database design, building of the framework,
build-out of the M-V-C components, server installation and setup, testing and staging,
and final deployment & maintenance.

## Company Websites

I've created many company/corporate websites, from simple single-page landing sites
to fully customized wordpress installations, with custom themes and custom plugins.

Here are a few of the most recent corporate websites built by Jon beebe.
