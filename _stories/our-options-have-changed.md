He first became aware of a rushing sensation. It was everywhere, surrounding him. He was hemmed in; immersed in a stream of—of something he could not name or place. He couldn’t actually feel it. He was merely aware of its omnipresence. 

Voices. 

They were garbled, distant, carried by the flow. Now that he focused on them they rose to a crescendo; a cacophony of voices surrounding and enveloping his senses. Instantly they overwhelmed him and threatened to sink him. Waves of senseless sound crashed over him. 

He then picked up on a distinct voice; the others faded to an imperceptible whisper. 

“…to check your account balance, press two. For questions concerning debit cards press three. For all other inquiries press four.…”

_An automated receptionist?_

The stream of words was vaguely familiar. Confusion abound. Where was he? And how did he get here?

The automated voice droned on, looping and repeating itself. He looked all over for the phone to make a selection. Where was it? Where was anything? He looked around to find his own hands, realizing he could not see or feel them.

“…debit cards press three. For all…” 

_Aaahh!_ Endless looping nonsense. Paths to nowhere. Infinite voids! Desperation began to engulf him. He steadied himself and tried to clear his mind. He closed his eyes, only to realize he had not been looking at anything. He—had no eyes? 

Why didn’t anything make sense!?

Those voices! Something about them seemed eerily familiar, a memory more real than any of having eyes or a body. 

“…if you know your parties extension press—”

A scream of frustration rang out from somewhere. The cold emotionless response gave him the chills.  “I’m sorry, that was an invalid selection, please select from the following…”

Another anguished scream, this one much nearer, echoed around the infinite expanse. He became enveloped in a cold breeze. A fearfully painful chill passed through him. For a moment it was _he_ who felt the anguish. And then it flowed passed, like all the sounds surrounding him. 

Countless souls seemed to swirl around him, making desperate attempts at getting through to the cold, soulless receptionists offering endless choices, but no way out. 

Bump!

He turned. At least that was his intention; he had no body to turn. Instead his surroundings seemed to obey; what was behind rotated into view. 

He stared at an open door. Just beyond it was a deep red mahogany desk with a name plate. Justin Davis. A computer sat open surrounded by sticky notes and markers. A whiteboard took up the entire back wall; project lanes were marked off with dutiful precision. 

Justin Davis. 

The name now seemed more familiar than anything he had experienced here.

_I’m…Justin Davis?_

Yes. That seemed right. This was his office. Except, not quite. It had never been this clean. 

He stepped in and—

Silence. 

Complete, painfully void silence. 

A blinking light on the desk phone caught his attention. He walked over, aware that he now had legs and arms. Someone was on hold. He pressed the button and the speaker phone burst to life. 

“Hey buddy! Justin, is that you!? You little devil. Where have you been hiding? Never mind. I’m having a hell of a time setting up this phone system you sold us. Can you send over…”

The memories returned. That’s why this place was so eerily familiar! He had sold these automated systems for a living. He clasped his chest in relief, trying to convince himself it was only a nightmare.

Relief was short lived. He moved to leave the office, but there was no door. There was no opening of any kind. A slight panic crept back. He reached for the phone and pressed the button to summon his secretary. 

The speaker phone came to life. “Hello, you have reached the sales department. Please listen carefully as our options have changed…”

Impossible! Not another robotic system! He mashed the zero to speak to an operator. 

“I’m sorry, that was not a valid selection. To repeat the menu press or say—”

“Operator!” he yelled. 

No response. 

He started to shake. He tried to throw the phone off the desk but it disappeared like a vapor. He looked down at his hands but again he had none. Then he was surrounded by robotic voices repeating their patterned speeches, and the occasional echoing cry of despair—a soul trapped in an endless maze of options with no ability to get out. 

And then he fell, as if he walked off the edge of a cliff. 

Tumbling to a stop he suddenly found himself unbearably hot. He looked around and saw he was in a small room. His name was emblazoned on the wall. The only other ornament was a phone.

He picked up the receiver. It was warm. 

Not knowing who to call he studied the phone’s faceplate. Scribbled on the bottom was a note to call the front desk if anything was out of order. He dialed. 

“Hello. Thank you for calling. I’m sorry, but all of our operators are busy. Your call matters to us and will be answered in the order it was received.”

He mashed the dial pad. 

“We’re sorry, that was not a valid entry. Please try again. If you know your parties extension you may dial it at any time.”

In frustration he blurted out “Aww _hell_!”

“One moment, connecting you to an operator.”

He froze. What—just—happened? 

It started ringing. 

Two rings. 

Three. 

Four. 

Then he heard a click and a scrounging noise. 

Justin yelled “Hello! Hello! This is Justin! Ca—”

A cold voice interrupted as sweat began to trickle down his brow. “Welcome to Hell. Your valued feedback has resulted in changes to our menu. Please listen carefully as our options have changed…”
