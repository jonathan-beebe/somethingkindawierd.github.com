“You think those little creatures are alive?”

“Sure. They seem to be. I mean, they’re pre-programmed with some basic stuff, things other animals would learned on their own. That’s the point of the blocks, you can mix ’n match em to create new creaturesd. But yeah, they’re alive.”

“How long do they usually live?”

“Not sure. Nancy is a stickler about the kids cleaning, so normally they recycle ‘em back into parts and put ‘em away. But I once found a little guy crawling around my desk. He was eating an eraser—super hungry—and Aaron said he’d made it last week. So they can last a while.”

“You say they eat too? Huh.” He looked pensive, watching his grandkids play with their newest gift. They had received an extension pack to their favorite BioBuddies™ set. The new pieces allowed them to build more advanced creatures. 

He picked up the lid and studied it. A young boy and girl were pictured assembling something, surrounded by animals they had already made. Across the top in bold childish writing it read “BioBuddies™, Building Blocks of Life”. A callout read “Intelligence Extension. Give your BioBuddies™ enhanced life with improved motor skills, larger associative memory, and refined sensory inputs. Ages 7+.” It also included a note about the new “Hierarchal Bayesian Network” that could be added, allowing your creatures to learn about their surroundings.

His son Jaden interrupted his study of the packaging, “Nancy had a heck of a time getting her hands on a set. They’ve been selling out everywhere.”

Grandpa replied “glad Nancy is ok. I heard about the chaos. Some poor grandma got trampled at the mall down my way—“

“I saw that on the news! Was she ok?” Nancy interrupted. 

“Dunno” came grandpa’s slow reply.

Jaden added excitedly, “been a while since a toy created this much buzz.”

He studied his son for a moment, “so, is it a toy, or is it alive?” 

“Huh? Whadya mean? Why can’t it be both? Not like you can’t have one without the other.” He saw the skepticism on his dad’s face so he emphasized, “it’s an educational toy that lets kids build pets. Learn about the building blocks of life. It teaches bioengineering, neurology, biomaterials, even a little chemistry. It’s designed to help them understand what life is made of.”

At that moment the kids howled with laughter. The adults all looked up to find the youngest had crawled near enough to grab a creature, stuffing it in his mouth and chewing with all the vigor of a teething baby. Nancy ran over and pulled it out, tossing it aside as she pulled her baby away.

“Awww, it’s not moving anymore,” squealed Jasmine. She picked it up by a leg; it hung limply, dripping drool.

Her older brother Aaron swiped it from her, “hurry, we need to recycle it or it won’t work anymore. Instructions say you can’t let ‘em die for too long.” He dunked it into the recycler, catching the branded parts that tumbled out. All evidence of teeth marks and drool were gone. 

Jasmine grabbed a part, exclaiming “oh, I needed one of those!”, fitting it into place on her new creation.

Grandpa looked pensive again. Jaden suddenly felt a need to defend himself. “You know it’s not actually recycling. Really, it’s just teaching them all that ‘dust to dust’ stuff you used to teach us kids.”

Grandpa raised his eyebrows and said nothing, still watching his grandkids play.

Jaden continued, “look, we’re just gonna become dust one day, you and I, and that dust will become something else, get recycled into something else. All this toy does is expedite the process so they can build again. Efficient, really.”

Grandpa remembered back to when he’d buried his wife. She died a few years back and he’d made sure she’d received a beautiful send-off. Gesturing towards his grandkids he asked, “what are they going to think when I die, Jaden? Are they going to wish I’d been recycled so they could have more parts? Turn me into toys?”

Jaden blurted, “its not even the same thing! Besides you can’t just recycle _anything_ into BioBuddies™. It only works with their stuff.”

Nancy interrupted everyone “time to go, reservations at 9. Kids, clean up and get ready.”

 Jasmine grabbed her favorite creature to bring with her. “No, time to clean up Jaz. You can play with it later.”

“Mo-om!” whined Jasmine.  

Aaron was already eagerly cleaning up. This was becoming his favorite moment. He placed the recycler on the table with the box below it on the floor. “Come on Jaz!” he yelled while performing a free throw toss with one of his creatures. It wriggled in the air as it tried to find footing, bounced on the rim, and fell into the recycler. His second was already in the air when the first tumbled out as clean parts, bouncing into the box. 

Jasmine giggled with delight, forgetting her battle with mom. She tossed her creature towards the table, eager to watch it become parts again.
