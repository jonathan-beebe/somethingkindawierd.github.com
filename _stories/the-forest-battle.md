In the silence of the afternoon, large leather bound book in my lap, I turned the pages, eagerly playing my part in the unfolding adventure.

Outside a flurry of wind nudged me back to reality. I glanced beyond the window towards the disturbance.

The trees were violently swaying, each bending and bowing, colliding with each other. I watched as two trees became entangled, the larger attacking with a heavy downward blow as the smaller bent and creaked in response. It then twisted and snapped upright, defending its space and thrusting the assailant aside. Branches snapped and fell as the scarred attacker arched back, angling for the next blow.  

All throughout the forest the trees were agitated and brawling. Their actions were so swift and fierce that they whipped up a windstorm that pummeled my living room window.

Or, was it the wind, whipping the trees into a tempest?

It was difficult to tell. Rain began to fall in sheets, blurring the battle, masking the sound of clashing, scraping branches.  

And just as swiftly, sunlight poured through. The trees calmed, straightened, and were again composed. The conflict was over. Silence returned. The pages of fiction beckoned me back.
