Earlier that evening Charles walked into the bioengineering laboratory of the University of Texas, San Antonio. He set a BioBuddies™ toy box on his workbench and began searching the computer for his design files.

The lab monitor walked by, “I think you’re in the wrong place Charles. These belong in the sandbox with the kiddos.”

“Mind your own business,” he chided back.

“You know my lab isn’t for fun and games. We do serious work here!” She smiled and walked away.

Serious work. He knew it was a joke, but seriously, if they only knew how serious he was. Charles knew most of his peers would have killed to get a job at ToyTech, the BioBuddies parent company. Currently a Wall Street favorite, they were the first to market a biotech toy approved for mass consumption and they were dominating. 

Charles found his designs and opened them. An intricate 3D model began rotating in front of him. He yelled across the lab, “Hey Amy, you done with the printer?”

“Yeah, just cleaning up now. It’s all yours.”  

Amy stopped by, “All clean. Say, what you need it for this evening? I thought you were done.”

“Oh, just need to tweak a couple of pieces is all.”

“Is that even legal?” she asked, gesturing from his 3D model to his BioBuddies set.

Strictly speaking the BioBuddies toy was a self-contained system closed for modification. ToyTech could not risk having live creatures, created from their parts, harming children. However it was only a matter of weeks before the biotech community had hacked it, allowing for a proliferation of custom mods printable via standard BioBots tissue printers. Any action ToyTech made to stop the mods only fueled the fire and drove the community deeper into the dark web, where an illegal trade in 3D models raged like an inferno.

This is where Charles played his advantage. The 3D tissue printer at his lab was far more advanced than consumer level printers. While most people could only mod their sets with cheap tricks and flashy facades, someone like Charles could be quite dangerous. 

He sent his design to the printer and smiled at Amy replying, “only if someone gets hurt.” They looked on as his design became flesh.

Officer Chitom placed the receiver back into its cradle as he sped down Basset St. His partner asked, “you ever taken a brawler’s fight before?”

“Yep, been to a few. You?”

“No. First time. What should I expect?”

“Blood, lots of blood. ’Time we get there they’ve usually scattered. But there’s always blood everywhere.”

His partner squirmed a bit, “Blood? I thought they just fought with robots.”

“Not these days. Kids are modding those bio toys to fight. Getting good from what I hear. They match a mech against a biobot. Usually the biobots lose, and bleed.”

After an uncomfortable silence he added, “Don’t worry. It’s not real; they’re just toys.”

---- 

Charles wiped the sweat from his glasses. The warehouse was 102° and rising. The frenzied crowds were pressing in, screaming for their fighter as the match raged on. Charles’ bot had managed to stand up to the mech for 7 rounds so far—4 rounds more than any previous fight. 

No one could believe it was still standing. The mech had inflicted incredible damage. Strips of flesh hung off its right side from a nasty gash. The ring was a pool of blood, each fighter splashing as it stepped. This was actually part of Charles’ strategy, a ruse to endear the crowd to the fight and throw the opponent into confusion. He had modded his bot with an extremely large blood supply and surface veins that served no purpose but to bleed easily.

Charles was boxing the air, shadow-fighting the mech. Of course his bot was fighting autonomously, but he couldn’t help feeling part of the fight. 

Suddenly the mech slipped in the pool of blood. It was just a few milliseconds of uncontrolled footwork, but it was enough. Charles’ bot saw the opening and dove in. With one swift downward thrust the mech’s left knee was shattered. Far from finishing the fight, the mech rebounded immediately and adjusted. But the tide had turned; Charles bot would win.

But the end never came. Suddenly the music stopped. An immediate silence pressed in on the crowd, magnifying the sound of the two fighters splashing in the bloody puddle. A boy ran up from the back yelling “brawlers gotta BOUNCE!” The cops were on their way.

The lights were extinguished and the crowd went from controlled chaos to pandemonium. Charles saw his opponent jump into the ring and grab his mech. He looked straight at Charles and kicked his bot to the opposite side of the ring. _Sore looser._

OFFICER CHITOM: Racers on Basset, north and sound bound!

SERGEANT PETERSON: I see them! In pursuit of a blue Bolt. At least 8 more headed north of Basset towards Cross Street.

DISPATCHER: Copy that. All available units, please respond to the Papermill Warehouse, Basset and Cross Street.

---- 

Charles sped away in his blue Bolt. _Damn. I wold have won. I **would have won!**_. Adrenalin-pumped images flashed through his mind as he anticipated the inevitable and violent rematch. Tonight his mods proved a biobot could win against a mech. Gripping his steering with white-knuckled ferocity he vowed to give the crowd something to cheer for next time.

Lights flashed across his face; Sergeant Peterson’s lights reflected in Charle’s rear view mirror. _Well_, Charles thought, _this will make for two illegal activities tonight_. He turned off his headlights and accelerated down a back alley towards the University lab.
