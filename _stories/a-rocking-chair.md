title: A Rocking Chair

I walked casually, not paying attention to my surroundings. Slowly walking, talking, thinking, enjoying the presence of my wife beside me. We walk past a small cul-de-sac towards a hidden dirt path. Here, tucked away from the public eye is the community recycle bin; the lazy person’s garbage heap. It’s far more convenient than driving up the street to the community trash compactor. I’ve grown so used to this scene it almost feels normal. An inward sigh. A few more steps. I’m almost past this brash carelessness of my neighbors.

My wife and I both do a slow double-take at the same moment. Amongst the misplaced trash is a small wicker rocking chair fit for a child. This adds to the sadness of the scene. I feel a tinge of loss and despair.

As we continue both of us silently wonder about the child who sat in that chair. I begin imagining scenes of our own child one day rocking in a chair of their own while reading a favorite book, gazing at oversized words and full-color illustrations. I laugh as tiny legs try to coordinate rocking, a brow furrowing over words not yet understood, skipping to the pictures instead. We’ve discussed this long ago; we won’t be having kids. But we glanced at each other with the same mischievous thought. 

We breezed past the trash and the “employees only” sign, walking down the dirt path. I am surprised she doesn’t object to this minor rebellion against authority. 

The dirt path is full of deep ruts from heavy rain and careless golf-cart drivers. Old battered stoves and water heaters pile high on each side, rusting in the moist southern air. Unkempt trees and bushes frame the path going forward.

I wordlessly admire this small, unspoiled bit of nature that surrounds us now. Small rays of light break through the brambles and tangled branches revealing the houses and yards just beyond. 

My feet meet pavement again and we turn towards our home. Once in our small apartment, I immediately go to the patio and start cleaning our newest piece of furniture; a seed of hope for a family we have yet to grow.
