This site is my digital résumé & portfolio; you can learn what I do for a living,
what I'm about, what keeps me ticking.

The following is my best attempt at summarizing it all.

# Vision Statement

*Or an answer to “why do I wake up in the morning?”*

1.  To experience the [abundant life](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2010:10&version=ESV "John 10:10 -- 'I came that they may have life and have it abundantly'") God intended.
2.  To exceed my wife's expectations every moment.
3.  To make a living bringing hope to the hopeless, light where it's dark, leaving the world better than I found it.

# Mission Statement

*Or an answer to “how am I going to make my vision a reality?”*

1.  [Practice the Presence of God](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13871 "Practicing the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence"), cultivating a daily, personal relationship with Him.
2.  Maintain my priorities: [God 1st](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206:5&version=NCV "Deuteronomy 6:5 -- 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength.'"), [marriage 2nd](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:25&version=NLT "Ephesians 5:25 -- 'For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her.'"), everything else 3rd.
3.  Contribute to effective & enduring projects with a likeminded team.
4.  Continually improve & use the skills, talents & gifts God gives me.
