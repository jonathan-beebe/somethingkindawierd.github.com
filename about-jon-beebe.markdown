About Jon Beebe
===============

This site is my digital résumé & portfolio; you can learn what I do for a living, 
what I'm about, what keeps me ticking.

What follows below is my best attempt at summarizing it all.

Vision Statement
==============

Or an answer to *"why do I wake up in the morning?"*

1.	To experience the [abundant life](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2010:10&version=ESV "John 10:10 -- 'I came that they may have life and have it abundantly'") God intended for us, living as an [example to the world](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20thes%204:11-12&version=NLT "1 Thessalonians 4:11-12 -- '...Then people who are not Christians will respect the way you live'"), then go home to heaven.
2.	To exceed my wife's expectations every moment of our lives.
3.	To make a living designing, writing, and growing [open-source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).

Mission Statement
===============

Or an answer to *"how am I going to make my vision a reality?"*

1.	[Practice the Presence of God](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13871 "Practicing the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence"), cultivating a daily, personal relationship with Him.
2.	Maintain my priorities: [God is 1st](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206:5&version=NCV "Deuteronomy 6:5 -- 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength.'"), [my marriage is 2nd](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:25&version=NLT "Ephesians 5:25 -- 'For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her.'"), everything else is 3rd.
2.	Contribute to active, useful open-source projects.
3.	Continually improve the skills God gave me, including my knowledge and use of software design and programming languages.
